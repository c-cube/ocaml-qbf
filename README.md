in OCaml.

## Organization

- The main library, `qbf`, contains types and functions to deal with
  representing boolean literals and quantified formulas, as well as
  a generic interface for solvers.
- A sub-library, `qbf.quantor`, contains a
  binding to the [quantor](http://fmv.jku.at/quantor/) QBF solver. The solver
  itself and [Picosat (version 535)](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) are packaged with
  the library for convenience (they are rarely packaged on distributions, and
  require some compilation options such as `-fPIC` to work with OCaml).

## Tested configurations

It works with any version of OCaml from 4.08.x to 4.10.x onwards.

1. tested on linux (Ubuntu 16.04, x86_64),
2. tested on MacOS,
3. tested on Windows using Cygwin32 and Cygwin64 by cross-compilating to
   native win32 under using the `mingw64-i686` (respectively `mingw64-x86_64`)
   cross-compiler.
4. Should also work under WSL and WSL2 on Windows 10.

## License

The library and its dependencies are licensed under the BSD license
(and the MIT license for picosat), which is fairly permissive.

## Installation

Using opam:

    opam install qbf

From source:

    opam install . --working-dir --deps-only
    dune build

## Known issues

* `process killed by signal -5` is due to a dlopen problem: the binary has been
  linked against the shared library `dllqbf-quantor_stubs.so` but this shared
  lib isn't installed yet.
* `process killed by signal -10` is still unknown. It was happening in
  travis-ci. My workaround was to remove the travis-ci cache (~/.opam was
  cached between two builds).

## Changelog

### 0.3 (2021-01-11)

- moved to [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) which has become the
  de-facto OCaml build tool.
- fix the `x86_64` build on Windows + Cygwin64 + the mingw64 toolchain.
- fix building ocaml-qbf using opam 2. Opam 2 is sandboxing builds and
  do not accept messing with /tmp
