In order to have a full QBF solver you need to compile Quantor with a SAT
solver back end.  Preferably you should use PicoSAT, but FunEx, NanoSAT and
Limmat, should work as well.  This new version of Quantor needs the
workds only with a reentrant version of PicoSAT, so at least version 953.

The 'configure' script will search in the parent directory in which you
unpacked the Quantor sources for the directories 'picosat', 'compsat' etc.
and whether they contain apropriate libraries.  If you have compiled PicoSAT
some where else, say in '$HOME/picosat-560', then use can simply configure
Quantor to use the libraries in that directory with 

  ./configure --picosat=$HOME/picosat-560'

Then 'make' should produce a 'quantor' binary.  The configure script
generates 'config.h' and 'options.c', the latter by using the 'genopts'
shell script.  This should work on a Unix system out of the box, and
also for 'cygwin'.  For other operating systems you need to change the
compilation process.  In the past we were successfully in producing a native
Windows binary with the mingw32 cross compiler.
